# model_uncertainty
This is the code to reproduce the majority of results in the paper accessible here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11jSJ3RNPMPSl1sRWMte8x6F67hg39MVZ/view?usp=sharing

(Step 0: Get Python 3.8) <br />
Step 1: download the repository <br />
Step 2: create a folder called venv <br />
Step 3: install the required libraries in your python terminal, go to the venv directory and use the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt <br />
Step 4: execute the python file named single_optimization_model_executions.py to reproduce the Figure 3b <br />
Step 5: execute the python file named reference_points to reproduce Figure 4, 5 and Figure 6a and 6b. The individual maps can be, however, shown as a sequence of plots and not exactly as shown in the paper. There will be other results shown that are not referred to in the article <br />
